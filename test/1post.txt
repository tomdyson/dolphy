The work that Soren and I started on a soundtrack for Charlie and Lola in November 2002 is now playing to a projected audience of 80 million children on the Disney Playhouse channel. It launches in the UK on BBC2 and CBeebies this autumn; it's been sold to TF1 (France), Sweden, Denmark, Norway and Australia; it will play pretty much everywhere that BBC Worldwide licenses TV: if you know three-to-six-year-old children who watch TV, the chances are that you'll see it.

The series of 26 episodes is based on Lauren Child's beautifully written and illustrated books, in which the patient, good-natured Charlie narrates stories about his little sister Lola. It's unusual in its use of children for the characters' voices; it feels fresher and more relaxed than most children's TV. John Greswell from MPM Music wrote most of the incidental music for the episodes, and helped us enormously with the theme tune arrangement.

To see the titles with our soundtrack, go to the production company's official site for the series, choose 'clips' and then 'titles'.

Update: here's a 60 second MP3 of the theme tune, which is copyright Tiger Aspect - thanks to Claudia Lloyd for letting me use it here.
